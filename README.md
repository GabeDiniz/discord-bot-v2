# ü§ñ Discord-bot v2

This is my multi-purpose Discord bot! This is the second Discord bot I created (new and improved). It utilizes several APIs to display üéÆ game statistics and information. It has basic response üó£ commands, and it can join your voice channel to play üéµ music!

# Want to run this bot yourself?

Assuming you have created a new Discord-bot (Application) at https://discord.com/developers/applications, you'll need to do the following.

```bash
# Download the repository
git clone <https-or-ssh>

# Create env file and add the following keys:
BOT_KEY="bot-application-key"
STEAM_API_KEY="steam-api-key"   # for Steam feature
GIPHY_API_KEY="giphy-api-key"   # for random gif feature (from api.giphy.com)

# Download the required libraries
# > In the bin directory of the project, run the import.bat file
./import.bat
```
